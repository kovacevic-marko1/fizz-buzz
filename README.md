# fizz-buzz
A simple FizzBuzz solution made in Java (IntelliJ)
Goes through a set amount of numbers (i.e 100) and every time it encounters one divisible by 3 it outputs Fizz, and when it hits one divisible by 5 it outputs Buzz. When its both 3 and 5 it gives out FizzBuzz, otherwise it just prints the number.
